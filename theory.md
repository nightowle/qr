## Enhanced Wave-Particle Duality Framework

Quantum mechanics reveals the fundamental dual nature of matter and energy at microscopic scales. The wave-particle duality is mathematically expressed through the de Broglie wavelength:

```
λ = h/p
```

Where λ is the de Broglie wavelength, h is Planck's constant, and p is momentum.

## Core Principles (AI 1 Enhanced)

### 1. Wave-Particle Duality
- Photons exhibit both wave and particle characteristics
- Matter waves described by probability amplitudes
- Complementarity principle governs observation

### 2. Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle
Enhanced formulation with energy-time uncertainty:
```
Δx · Δp ≥ ℏ/2
ΔE · Δt ≥ ℏ/2
```

### 3. Quantum Entanglement
Non-local correlations described by Bell's theorem:
- Violation of Bell inequalities
- EPR paradox resolution
- Quantum information applications

## Mathematical Framework Enhancement

### Time-Dependent Schrödinger Equation
```
iℏ ∂ψ/∂t = Ĥψ
```

### Time-Independent Form
```
Ĥψ = Eψ
```

### Probability Density
```
ρ(x,t) = |ψ(x,t)|²
```
