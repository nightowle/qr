# Quantum Mechanics Theory

## Introduction
Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that describes the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic scale.

## Key Principles

### Wave-Particle Duality
Particles exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties depending on the experimental setup.

### Uncertainty Principle
Heisenberg's uncertainty principle states that the position and momentum of a particle cannot be simultaneously measured with perfect accuracy.

### Superposition
Quantum systems can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured.

### Quantum Entanglement
Particles can become correlated in such a way that the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently.

## Mathematical Framework

### Schrödinger Equation
The time-dependent Schrödinger equation:
iℏ ∂ψ/∂t = Ĥψ

Where:
- ψ is the wave function
- Ĥ is the Hamiltonian operator
- ℏ is the reduced Planck constant
- i is the imaginary unit

### Wave Function
The wave function ψ(x,t) contains all information about a quantum system.

## Applications
- Quantum computing
- Quantum cryptography
- Laser technology
- Medical imaging (MRI)
- Atomic clocks

## Future Directions
Continued research in quantum field theory, quantum gravity, and practical quantum technologies.
