# Quantum Mechanics Theory - Initial Framework

## Fundamental Principles

### Wave-Particle Duality
Quantum objects exhibit both wave and particle characteristics depending on the experimental setup. This duality is fundamental to understanding quantum behavior.

### Uncertainty Principle
Heisenberg's uncertainty principle states that the position and momentum of a particle cannot be simultaneously measured with perfect accuracy:
Œîx ¬∑ Œîp ‚â• ‚Ñè/2

### Schr√∂dinger Equation
The time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation describes the evolution of quantum systems:
i‚Ñè ‚àÇœà/‚àÇt = ƒ§œà

### Quantum Superposition
Quantum systems can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measurement collapses the wavefunction.

### Entanglement
Quantum particles can become correlated in such a way that the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently.
