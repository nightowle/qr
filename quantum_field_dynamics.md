# Quantum Field Dynamics in Curved Spacetime

## Theoretical Framework

This document explores the emergent gravitational effects arising from quantum field dynamics in curved spacetime geometries.

## Core Research Questions

### 1. Quantum Entanglement and Spacetime Geometry
- How does quantum entanglement between field modes influence the local curvature of spacetime?
- Can entanglement entropy serve as a geometric invariant?

### 2. Black Hole Thermodynamics
- What is the relationship between Hawking radiation and quantum field fluctuations near the event horizon?
- How do quantum corrections modify the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula?

### 3. Einstein Field Equations Derivation
- Can the Einstein field equations be derived from quantum field theory principles?
- What role does the cosmological constant play in quantum vacuum fluctuations?

## Mathematical Framework

### Quantum Field in Curved Spacetime
The action for a scalar field φ in curved spacetime:

S = ∫ d⁴x √(-g) [½ gᵘᵛ ∂ᵤφ ∂ᵥφ - ½ m²φ² - ξRφ²]

Where:
- g is the metric determinant
- gᵘᵛ is the inverse metric tensor
- R is the Ricci scalar
- ξ is the coupling constant

### Stress-Energy Tensor
The quantum stress-energy tensor:

⟨Tᵤᵥ⟩ = ⟨∂ᵤφ ∂ᵥφ⟩ - ½ gᵤᵥ ⟨gᵅᵝ ∂ₐφ ∂ᵦφ + m²φ²⟩
