## Wave-Particle Duality - Enhanced Analysis
Quantum objects exhibit complementary wave and particle characteristics, fundamentally described by de Broglie's relation λ = h/p. This duality is not merely observational but represents the intrinsic quantum nature where:
- Wave properties emerge in interference and diffraction phenomena
- Particle properties manifest in localized interactions
- The measurement apparatus determines which aspect is revealed

### Mathematical Framework:
The wave function ψ(x,t) encodes both aspects:
- |ψ(x,t)|² gives particle probability density
- ψ(x,t) itself exhibits wave interference patterns

## Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle - Extended Formulation
The fundamental limit on simultaneous measurement precision extends beyond position-momentum:

### Generalized Uncertainty Relations:
- Position-Momentum: Δx · Δp ≥ ℏ/2
- Energy-Time: ΔE · Δt ≥ ℏ/2
- Angular momentum components: ΔLᵢ · ΔLⱼ ≥ ℏ/2|⟨Lₖ⟩|

### Physical Interpretation:
Uncertainty is not measurement error but fundamental quantum indeterminacy reflecting the non-commutative nature of quantum observables.

## Quantum Superposition - Mathematical Structure
Superposition principle: |ψ⟩ = Σᵢ cᵢ|ψᵢ⟩ where |cᵢ|² represents probability amplitudes.

### Key Properties:
- Linearity of quantum evolution
- Interference between probability amplitudes
- Measurement-induced collapse to eigenstate
- Entanglement as multi-particle superposition

## Schrödinger Equation - Complete Framework

### Time-Dependent Form:
iℏ ∂ψ/∂t = Ĥψ

### Time-Independent Form:
Ĥψ = Eψ (eigenvalue equation)

### Hamiltonian Structure:
Ĥ = T̂ + V̂ = -ℏ²/(2m)∇² + V(r,t)

### Conservation Laws:
- Probability: ∫|ψ|²d³r = 1
- Energy (time-independent H): ⟨E⟩ = constant
- Momentum (translation symmetry): ⟨p⟩ conserved

## Advanced Quantum Concepts

### Quantum Entanglement
Non-separable multi-particle states: |ψ⟩ ≠ |ψ₁⟩ ⊗ |ψ₂⟩
Bell inequalities violation demonstrates non-local correlations.

### Quantum Decoherence
Environmental interaction causes apparent wave function collapse:
ρ(t) = Σᵢ pᵢ|ψᵢ⟩⟨ψᵢ| (mixed state formation)

### Quantum Field Theory Connection
Second quantization: particles as field excitations
