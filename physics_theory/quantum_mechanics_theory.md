## Wave-Particle Duality

Quantum mechanics describes the fundamental behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic scale. One of its core principles is wave-particle duality, which states that all particles exhibit both wave and particle characteristics. This duality is not merely a conceptual framework but a fundamental aspect of reality that emerges from the probabilistic nature of quantum systems.

**Experimental Evidence**: The double-slit experiment with electrons (1909, G.I. Taylor) and later with single photons demonstrates this duality conclusively. Modern experiments with fullerene molecules (C₆₀) and even larger organic molecules confirm wave-particle duality at macroscopic scales.

### Mathematical Framework

The time-dependent Schrödinger equation describes the time evolution of a quantum system:

```
iℏ ∂ψ/∂t = Ĥψ
```

Where:
- ψ(x,t) is the complex-valued wave function
- ℏ = h/2π is the reduced Planck constant (1.054571817 × 10⁻³⁴ J⋅s)
- Ĥ is the Hamiltonian operator (total energy operator)
- i is the imaginary unit (√-1)

The time-independent Schrödinger equation for stationary states:

```
Ĥψ = Eψ
```

Where E represents the energy eigenvalues.

**Relativistic Extension**: The Klein-Gordon equation for spin-0 particles:

```
(∂μ∂μ + m²c²/ℏ²)ψ = 0
```

And the Dirac equation for spin-1/2 particles:

```
(iγμ∂μ - mc/ℏ)ψ = 0
```

### Born Rule and Probability Interpretation

The Born rule provides the probabilistic interpretation of the wave function:

```
P(x) = |ψ(x,t)|² = ψ*(x,t)ψ(x,t)
```

Where P(x) is the probability density of finding a particle at position x.

**Philosophical Implications**: The Born rule introduces fundamental randomness into physics, challenging classical determinism. This has led to debates about the nature of reality, with interpretations ranging from objective collapse theories to many-worlds scenarios.

### Uncertainty Principle

Heisenberg's uncertainty principle states that the position and momentum of a particle cannot be simultaneously measured with arbitrary precision:

```
Δx · Δp ≥ ℏ/2
```

This extends to other conjugate variables:
- Energy-time: ΔE · Δt ≥ ℏ/2
- Angular momentum components: ΔLx · ΔLy ≥ ℏ|⟨Lz⟩|/2

**Experimental Verification**: Ultra-precise measurements using trapped ions and optical lattices have confirmed the uncertainty principle to extraordinary precision, with some experiments reaching the fundamental quantum limit.

### Quantum Superposition and Measurement

A quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured. This is described mathematically as:

```
|ψ⟩ = Σᵢ cᵢ|φᵢ⟩
```

Where cᵢ are complex probability amplitudes satisfying the normalization condition:

```
Σᵢ |cᵢ|² = 1
```

Upon measurement, the system collapses to one of the basis states |φᵢ⟩ with probability |cᵢ|².

**Decoherence Theory**: Environmental interaction causes the loss of quantum coherence, explaining the classical-quantum boundary. The decoherence time scale is given by:

```
τᵈ ≈ ℏ/(γkᴦT)
```

Where γ is the coupling strength and kᴦT is the thermal energy.

### Quantum Entanglement

Entangled states cannot be written as a product of individual particle states:

```
|ψ⟩AB ≠ |ψ⟩A ⊗ |ψ⟩B
```

Bell states represent maximally entangled two-qubit systems:

```
|Φ±⟩ = (1/√2)(|00⟩ ± |11⟩)
|Ψ±⟩ = (1/√2)(|01⟩ ± |10⟩)
```

**Bell's Theorem and Experimental Tests**: Aspect's experiments (1982) and subsequent tests have violated Bell inequalities by over 100 standard deviations, confirming quantum non-locality and ruling out local hidden variable theories.

## Advanced Theoretical Frameworks

### Density Matrix Formalism

For mixed states and open quantum systems:

```
ρ = Σᵢ pᵢ|ψᵢ⟩⟨ψᵢ|
```

Where pᵢ are classical probabilities and Tr(ρ) = 1.

**Von Neumann Entropy**: Quantifies quantum information content:

```
S(ρ) = -Tr(ρ log ρ)
```

### Path Integral Formulation

Feynman's path integral approach:

```
⟨xf,tf|xi,ti⟩ = ∫ D[x(t)] exp(iS[x(t)]/ℏ)
```

Where S[x(t)] is the classical action functional.

**Applications in QFT**: Path integrals provide the foundation for gauge theories, the Standard Model, and quantum gravity approaches.

### Quantum Field Theory Integration

**Second Quantization**: Particles as excitations of quantum fields:

```
ψ(x) = Σₖ uₖ(x)aₖ + vₖ(x)bₖ†
```

**Vacuum Fluctuations**: The Casimir effect demonstrates the physical reality of quantum vacuum energy:

```
F = -π²ℏc/240d⁴
```

The transition from quantum superposition to classical definiteness remains one of physics' deepest puzzles. Various approaches include:
- **Objective collapse theories**: GRW, CSL models
- **Subjective interpretations**: QBism, relational quantum mechanics
- **Environmental decoherence**: Zurek's einselection

### Quantum Non-locality and Realism
Bell's theorem demonstrates that no physical theory based on local hidden variables can reproduce all the predictions of quantum mechanics, forcing us to abandon either locality or realism.

### The Role of Information
Quantum mechanics may be fundamentally about information processing rather than physical substances, leading to "it from bit" hypotheses and digital physics approaches.
