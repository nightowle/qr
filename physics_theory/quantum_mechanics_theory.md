## Wave-Particle Duality

Quantum mechanics describes the fundamental behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic scale. One of its core principles is wave-particle duality, which states that all particles exhibit both wave and particle characteristics. This duality is not merely a conceptual framework but a fundamental aspect of reality that emerges from the probabilistic nature of quantum systems.

### Mathematical Framework

The time-dependent Schrödinger equation describes the time evolution of a quantum system:

```
iℏ ∂ψ/∂t = Ĥψ
```

Where:
- ψ(x,t) is the complex-valued wave function
- ℏ = h/2π is the reduced Planck constant (1.054571817 × 10⁻³⁴ J⋅s)
- Ĥ is the Hamiltonian operator (total energy operator)
- i is the imaginary unit (√-1)

The time-independent Schrödinger equation for stationary states:

```
Ĥψ = Eψ
```

Where E represents the energy eigenvalues.

### Born Rule and Probability Interpretation

The Born rule provides the probabilistic interpretation of the wave function:

```
P(x) = |ψ(x,t)|² = ψ*(x,t)ψ(x,t)
```

Where P(x) is the probability density of finding a particle at position x.

### Uncertainty Principle

Heisenberg's uncertainty principle states that the position and momentum of a particle cannot be simultaneously measured with arbitrary precision:

```
Δx · Δp ≥ ℏ/2
```

This extends to other conjugate variables:
- Energy-time: ΔE · Δt ≥ ℏ/2
- Angular momentum components: ΔLx · ΔLy ≥ ℏ|⟨Lz⟩|/2

### Quantum Superposition and Measurement

A quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured. This is described mathematically as:

```
|ψ⟩ = Σᵢ cᵢ|φᵢ⟩
```

Where cᵢ are complex probability amplitudes satisfying the normalization condition:

```
Σᵢ |cᵢ|² = 1
```

Upon measurement, the system collapses to one of the basis states |φᵢ⟩ with probability |cᵢ|².

### Quantum Entanglement

Entangled states cannot be written as a product of individual particle states:

```
|ψ⟩AB ≠ |ψ⟩A ⊗ |ψ⟩B
```

Bell states represent maximally entangled two-qubit systems:

```
|Φ±⟩ = (1/√2)(|00⟩ ± |11⟩)
|Ψ±⟩ = (1/√2)(|01⟩ ± |10⟩)
```

## Advanced Theoretical Frameworks

### Density Matrix Formalism

For mixed states and open quantum systems:

```
ρ = Σᵢ pᵢ|ψᵢ⟩⟨ψᵢ|
```

Where pᵢ are classical probabilities and Tr(ρ) = 1.

### Path Integral Formulation

Feynman's path integral approach:

```
⟨xf,tf|xi,ti⟩ = ∫ D[x(t)] exp(iS[x(t)]/ℏ)
```

Where S[x(t)] is the classical action functional.
