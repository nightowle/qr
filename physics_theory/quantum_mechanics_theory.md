## Wave-Particle Duality

Quantum mechanics describes the fundamental behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic scale. One of its core principles is wave-particle duality, which states that all particles exhibit both wave and particle characteristics.

### Mathematical Framework

The Schrödinger equation describes the time evolution of a quantum system:

```
iℏ ∂ψ/∂t = Ĥψ
```

Where:
- ψ is the wave function
- ℏ is the reduced Planck constant
- Ĥ is the Hamiltonian operator
- i is the imaginary unit

### Uncertainty Principle

Heisenberg's uncertainty principle states that the position and momentum of a particle cannot be simultaneously measured with arbitrary precision:

```
Δx · Δp ≥ ℏ/2
```

### Quantum Superposition

A quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured. This is described mathematically as:

```
|ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩
```

Where α and β are complex probability amplitudes.
